# Cleaning-Product-Program

We	are	going	to	build	a	project	that	includes	a	Product	Class that	contains	basic	information	about	a	product,	name,	sku,	price	
â€“ these	are	attributes	that	every	product	has.		
Then	we	will	create	a	FoodProduct	Class that	extends	the	product	class	and	then	has	attributes	that	every	food	product	has	
such	as	expiration	date,	refrigeration	requirements,	serving	size,	calories	and	list	of	allergens.
We	will	create	a	CleaningProduct	Class that	extends	the	product	class	and	has	attributes	such	as	chemical	name,	hazards,	
first	aid	and	precautions.		It	will	also	contain	a	list	of	uses	(e.g.	carpet,	kitchen,	bath,	glass,	etc).
We	will	also	create	two	interfaces:	Edible and	Chemical that	will	require	some	specific	values	be	set	and	get.
